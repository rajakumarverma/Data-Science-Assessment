# Data Science Project Assessment

## Overview

Welcome to the Data Science Project Assessment repository! This project focuses on data preprocessing tasks, specifically handling missing values, capitalizing the first letter of the name column, removing duplicates, merging name and surname columns, and separating contact numbers in the mobile column. This assessment is designed to evaluate your skills in data cleaning and preparation.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Check Missing Values

Check for missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately. Use tools like pandas or any other libraries you are comfortable with.

### Task 2: Remove Duplicates

Ensure that the first letter of the "name" column is capitalized. This is necessary for consistency and presentation.

### Task 3: Capitalize First Letter 

Identify and remove duplicate values from the dataset. Keep the data unique for accurate analysis.

### Task 4: Merge Name and Surname

Create a new column that combines the "name" and "surname" columns to simplify data representation.

### Task 5: Separate Contact Numbers

In the "mobile" column, there are two contact numbers separated by a delimiter. Create new columns to store these numbers separately.

### Task 6: Create Alternate Number Column

Create a new column to store the alternate contact number, if available, from the "mobile" column.
